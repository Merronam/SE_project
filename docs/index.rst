Welcome to us_vis's documentation!
==================================
**US-VIS** is a Python module that helps process and visualize umbrella sampling
runs obtained through *AMBER* (https://ambermd.org/index.php) and pre-processed
by *WHAM* (http://membrane.urmc.rochester.edu/?page_id=126). It visualises the
data and gives the options to delete runs, informs about the data and allows 
merging pictures.
