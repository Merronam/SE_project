Functions available in the module
---------------------------------

.. py:function:: col_names(data)

        Adds column names. Assumes odd columns are coordinates and even columns are energy values. Only first column gets "Coord" name, the rest are left nameless. The energy columns are names "USX", where X is 10, 20, 30, etc.

        :param data: Dataset that contains US runs
        :type data: pandas.DataFrame
        :return data: Data with column names.
        :return work_columns: List of column names (without Coord)

.. py:function:: sub_min(data, work_columns)

        Looks for minimum value of each run on the substrate side of the reaction coordinate and substracts it from all values for this run. 

        :param data: Dataset that contains US runs, must be named with ``col_names()`` or with the same convention.
        :type data: pandas.DataFrame
        :param work_columns: A list of columns that contain energies (USX (X = 10, 20, 30..) by convention).
        :type work_columns: list[str]
        :return data: Returns dataset with substracted values.

.. py:function:: vis_fun(data, work_columns, name)
        
        Visualises processed dataset, based on the names of columns in work-columns list and adds title ("name"). 

        :param data: Dataset that contains US runs, must be name with col_names() or with the same convention.
        :type data: pandas.DataFrame
        :param work_columns: A list of columns that contain energies (USX (X = 10, 20, 30..) by convention).
        :type work_columns: list[str]
        :param name: The title of the figure displayed at the top
        :type name: str

.. py:function:: vis_show(data, work_columns, name)

        Shows the picture generated by ``vis_fun()``. All parameters are the same as for ``vis_fun()``

.. py:function:: vis_save(data, work_columns, name)

        Saves the picture generated by ``vis_fun()``. All parameters are the same as for ``vis_fun()`` 

.. py:function:: odd_col(data, work_columns)

        Designed to find incorrect runs (the ones that constantly increase instead of forming a maximum)

        :param data: Dataset that contains US runs, must be named with ``col_names()`` or with the same convention.
        :type data: pandas.DataFrame
        :param work_columns: A list of columns that contain energies (USX (X = 10, 20, 30..) by convention).
        :type work_columns: list[str]
        :return odd_out: A list of columns that contain incorrect runs
        
.. py:function:: split_string(list_strings)

        Splits a input of strings separated by space into list of strings.

        :param list_string: A long string of strings separated by a space
        :type list_strings: [str]
        :return list_strings: A list of string 
    
.. py:function:: del_col(work_columns, columns)
        
        Mostly used with user input - function creates the list of runs without the ones that are mentioned in "columns".

        :param work_columns: A list of columns that contain energies (USX (X = 10, 20, 30..) by convention).
        :type work_columns: list[str]
        :param columns: Columns that should be excluded from work_columns
        :type columns: list[str]

.. py:function:: spread(data, odd_out)
        
        Calculates if the spread (the difference between the maximum and minimum of energy in the product side) is smaller than 20.

        :param data: Dataset that contains US runs, must be named with ``col_names()`` or with the same convention.
        :type data: pandas.DataFrame
        :param odd_out: A list of columns that contain incorrect runs
        :type odd_out: list[str]
       
.. py:function:: list_pics(pics)

        Adds .png extension to the list of stings. 

        :param pics: A list of pictures' names.
        :type pics: list[str]
        :return pics: A list of pictures' names with extension .png

.. py:function:: merge(pics, columns, name)

        Merges pictures into one big figure. A number of pictures horizontally is descirbed by *columns* argument. Name of the file is specified by *name*.

        :param pics: A list of pictures' names with extension .png
        :type pics: list[str]
        :param columns: A number of pictures horizontally
        :type columns: int
        :param name: A name of the merged file
        :type name: str
